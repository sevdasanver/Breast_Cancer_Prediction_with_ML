# Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. According to the American Cancer Society, about 1 in 8 women in the United States will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime. Early detection through regular screening is crucial for reducing breast cancer mortality rates.

Breast cancer prediction is very important because it can help identify individuals who may be at risk for developing breast cancer. Early detection and treatment of breast cancer is critical for improving the chances of successful treatment and recovery. By predicting who is at risk for developing breast cancer, healthcare providers can recommend appropriate screening and preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of developing the disease or detect it early when it is most treatable.

Breast cancer occurs as a result of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). 

The goal of this study is to use machine learning techniques to prediction of the breast tumor type.

# Objective of this study:

1)Identifying the problem 

2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3)Pre-processing the data

4)Building a model to predict whether breast tumor tissue is malignant or benign


 * Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been selected as predictive model.
